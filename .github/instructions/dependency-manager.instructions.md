# Dependency Manager best practices

<!-- Only for release ? -->
- When the version of the application contains "RELEASE", could you check if there is a more recent stable version available for the dependencies and if so please add it into the "CHANGELOG.md" file.

- Add a comment that contains a link to the maven repository when you add a new dependency.
